This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: placing the COPY instruction after the RUN instruction that installs dependencies.  This results in the application code not being present during the dependency installation phase.

The `Dockerfile_bug.txt` shows the incorrect order, while `Dockerfile_solution.txt` presents the corrected version.  The solution ensures dependencies are installed before the application code is copied into the image, avoiding the error.

This is a subtle but important point for creating efficient and correctly functioning Docker images.
